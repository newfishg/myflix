A P2P file sharing application built from scratch in Ruby.

Inspired by BitTorrent, IPFS, and P2P Systems past and current, I set out to build one from scratch. Xorro P2P features a full implementation of a Kademlia distributed hash table in Ruby, an administrative web UI built in Sinatra, file sharding and re-assembly, and shard retrieval from multiple sources.

After discovering my passion for software development, I dove into the world of object-oriented programming, languages like Ruby and JavaScript, and fundamentals like SQL and TDD. My favorite project to date is Xorro P2P, a BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer file sharing network built from scratch. Check it out here: http://xorro-p2p.github.io

Interested in many areas of tech, I am looking for software development opportunities where I can bring in my strong background in product management, project management, UX and web design.
